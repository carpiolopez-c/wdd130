    <h1>Venice</h1>
    <p>Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the region of Veneto. It is built on a group of 118
        islands
        that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by 438 bridges</p>
    <p>The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city was
        the capital of the Republic of Venice for almost a millennium, from 810 to 1797.</p>
